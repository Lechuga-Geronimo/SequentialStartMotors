# Analog-Sequential-Starting-of-three-Single-Phase-AC-Motors

Year: 2011.

Objective: 
To design a completely analogic circuit capable of starting three single-phase AC motors of 1/4 HP each one.

Description: 

The three AC motors are named as "A", "B" and "C". Each one is activable in a independent manner, powered by a common electrical source of 127V AC at 60 Hz.
Only analogic elements are allowed to conform the circuit (i.e. resistors, capacitors, transistors, diodes), and NE555 timers. The number of elements are not specified. 

For simulation, the software chosen is LiveWire for an early stage, considering Proteus (more specific, Isis) for a definitive version. 
The circuit is conformed by two stages: control circuit and power circuit. Both circuits are isolated. 

The operation is described as follows:

1.- After 3 seconds of single-pushed one "Start" push button, the motor "A" starts
